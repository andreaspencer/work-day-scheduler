# Third Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description 
This week the challenge was to create a daily work scheduler to keep track of tasks and deadlines per day. The scheduler uses moment and local storage to keep track of date and tasks per hour.

### Acceptance Criteria
* Current date is displayed
* Time Blocks for a standard work day
* Color coded time blocks for past, present, and future 
* Click on time block and enter an event
* Press save to save event to the time block
* Refresh the page and the event is still there

#### Locally Download Instructions
1. clone github repository from ssh link
2. open terminal to desired cloning location then type in following:
    * git clone git@github.com:andreaspencer/work-day-scheduler.git
    * cd personal-portfolio
    * code .
        * this last step will open the code in VS studios to view code on local machine


##### My Work
* Created time blocks in html using bootstrap 
* Used an icon from bootstrap for the save button
* Added in column and row features using bootstrap
* Used Moment to get the date at the top of the page
* Used a time tracker to change the colors of the hours depending on past, present, or future.
* Added in additional CSS styling to make the scheduler unique
* Used local storage to save events to the page
